<div class="main">
    <p>You can sponsor Staticaly by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing us your service for free (CDN, DNS, web hosting, anything else we might need)</li>
        <li>Making monthly donations to help us cover development costs and other expenses</li>
        <li>Donating development hours of your employees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your sponsorship level is based on the value of your monthly donation. For example, to become a <strong>Prime</strong> sponsor, you need to sponsor a service worth $100 - 499 per month, donate the same amount of money, or corresponding number of development hours.</p>

    <p>You can <a class="white" href="/contact">contact us</a> anytime if you have any questions.</p>
